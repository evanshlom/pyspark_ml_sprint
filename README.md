This python notebook demonstrates a formula for prototyping a machine learning model quickly. In the notebook, there are two pipelines. The first pipeline ingests training data, then trains and saves a new model. The second pipeline serves the model.

The second algorithm would be ready for deployment using components from Snowflake's Streamlit library.
